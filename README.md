# etch-a-sketch

The Odin Project Foundations Project

This Project is a browser-based attempt to create something between an etch-a-sketch and a sketchpad.

Skills Demonstrated:
-DOM Manipulation
-CSS Grid

I attempted this solution on my own up to a point then saved them in scratch files. I attempted this a second time in a separate branch, however I was unable to achieve the correct button functionality.
I'm do not like the 'mouseover' event used to draw on the board. I'd prefer the precision of a 'click' event.
One feature I'd like to add is a button that opens a color wheel so that the user may select a color.
