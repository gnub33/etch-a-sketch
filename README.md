# etch-a-sketch

The Odin Project Foundations Project

This Project is a browser-based attempt to create something between an etch-a-sketch and a sketchpad.

Skills Demonstrated:
-DOM Manipulation
-HTML Forms
-CSS Grid

The slider function was the hardest feature to implement. I found a solution but the readibility of my code suffers from it.
The preview shows different background colors then what the link has. An error occured on my last 'push'.
I hope to implment a 'fill' function in the feature and make changes to the overall design.
