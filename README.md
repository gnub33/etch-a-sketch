So I know this is a readme and not a confessional but I'm doing this here anyway. After adding the "hovering" hovering feature to change the color of my squares, I hit a wall. So I abandoned my code and looked to a tutorial. I'm not proud, but I wasn't getting anywhere. I had no idea how implement the next required feature. The code I used to create the squares could only add more squares adjacent to the existing ones. I had no idea how to change the resolution and no patience to ask for help on discord.

With that said, the tutorial was revolutionary. The guy probably did some prep but his solution only took a few lines to solve the "required" tasks. I followed a long and now I can easily enter a number and change to resolution of my grid (without altering the total area). So as penance for cheating, I will explain to the best of my ability how the code works, so that I can re-affirm my understanding.

1. Setting Up
- Cloning Github repo
-Set up files in visual studio
-Add a reset stylesheet
-Boilerplate html

2. Set up HTML
- link stylesheets to header
- link script after body element
- create divs for content
- buttons to manipulate grid interactions
- text input box for grid size
